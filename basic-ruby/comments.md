## Comments (and Why We Tend to Avoid Them)

1. Take a break from the exercises for a bit. Explain why we say that 'comments lie'?
  * We say that comments lie because they tend to become depercated and they can tell the behavior of the method that, actually, isn't like that anymore. 

2. If we don't trust comments, how do we explain our code adequately to others?
  * If we write code by following a certain well defined conventions like naming (methods, variables) properly and by follow some structure like don't write methods with more than two levels of identation or with more than 5 lines. 

3. Explain what 'self documenting code' means in your own words
  * The idea is to have simple and high level code that is almost like if you are readding English.

4. Exercise: Knows the cases where comments are really necessary
  * Generally they are not necessary! If it is necessary may be the code needs to be refactored. In pontual cases, if one line of code that is needed but it is not simple to understand, one comment may not hurt.
