## The Testing Mindset

### Exercise: Knows why we "Don't trust the developer"
1. Developers are a tricky bunch. Name some reasons why you shouldn't just trust the person who wrote the code.
- If the developer write the code is because he thinks that the code is write, otherwise he didn't write it.
- Developers often overlook fundamentals ambiguities in requirements in order to complete the project.

2. Name some mental pitfalls that you should watch out for when testing code.
- Software tester must be pedantic, sceptical and nit-picking to software.

3. So then, why shouldn't we be satisfied with testing our own code?
- Because when we test our code, we may tend to rethink the possible flaws that we already think when we had write the code. So, probably we will make test that will pass on our code.

### Exercise: Understands Red -> Green -> Refactor

1. red / green / refactor concists in write the tests that will fail, initially (Red). Then we write the code with pass the test as main objective. After that, refactor consists in use the good conventions that will make the code cleaner, like simple methods and naming.
