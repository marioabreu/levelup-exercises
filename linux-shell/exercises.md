## Getting Around the Filesystem: Absolute and Relative Paths

1. Absolute path is used when we want to refer to some directory by specifying the path from the root (/), for instance '/usr/bin/bash' or '/Users/Some_user/Desktop/'. 
The relative path is the path we refer from the current directory we are located at, for instance 'cd some_folder/example/' is for change directory to the sub directory some_folder/example/ . 

2. Navegating to my home directory (~) i reached '/Users/marioabreu' 

3. Navigating upward two directories cd ../.. i reached the root (/)


## Everything is a File

1. Folders, Hard drive, keyboard, processes.

2. We use file descriptors when we use pipes.

## Path and the Environment

1. env
env | grep EDITOR
The environment variable was not defined, so i used 'export EDITOR=vim' to define it.

2. echo $PATH

3. which ruby
